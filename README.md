## BiMesh: Image-based meshing of binary media

`BiMesh` is a simple MATLAB code for meshing a binary medium using Gmsh (http://geuz.org/gmsh/) and image-based techniques. The binary medium is assumed to be comprised of inclusions embedded in a connected sub-domain. The code reads in an image of the binary domain and identifies the coordinates of the inclusion boundaries, which are then used to define the geometry in Gmsh and ultimately mesh the domain.

The code accomodates three different options: the full domain, the connected sub-domain only and the inclusion sub-domain only:

## Installation

`BiMesh` can be downloaded from

https://github.com/elliotcarr/BiMesh/archive/master.zip

After unzipping, you will need to add the directory to the MATLAB path. You can do
this via the command:
```
addpath(pathname)
```
where `pathname` is the path to the unzipped directory.
